# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repository contains completed deep learning projects and training experiments using PyTorch. It was built alongside the [**PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp**](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-deep-learning/) by Daniel Bourke and significantly expanded with production-grade features, including modular training scripts, MLflow integration, ONNX export, and FastAPI inference.

## ‚úÖ Highlights

* End-to-end CNN pipeline with evaluation, logging, and model saving
* MLflow experiment tracking with custom run logic
* ONNX export for portable model inference
* FastAPI server for real-time predictions
* Visualizations: loss curves, confusion matrices, and decision boundaries
* Reusable utilities for training, data loading, and evaluation
* Loguru-based logging for clean console + file output
