# Deep Learning with PyTorch (WIP)

This repository contains hands-on experiments and learning notebooks from my deep learning journey using PyTorch. It complements the PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp (Daniel Bourke) and expands with my own implementations, visuals, and MLflow integrations.

## Contents

### `classification/`
Binary classification experiments with visualizations, training loops, and MLflow tracking.

- `binary_classification_circles_mlflow.ipynb`: Train a simple neural net on synthetic data (circle pattern) and log metrics to MLflow.
- `activations_from_scratch.ipynb`: Explore how different activation functions behave and plot them from first principles.
- `decision_boundary.png`: Decision boundary visualization generated from trained model outputs.

## Tools & Libraries
- `PyTorch` for model development
- `MLflow` for experiment tracking
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for plotting
- `loguru` for structured logging

## Status
This is an active WIP repo. Additional modules to come:
- CNNs and vision models
- Modular training scripts
- ONNX model export and FastAPI deployment

Stay tuned.
