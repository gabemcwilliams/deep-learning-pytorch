# FashionMNIST CNN with MLflow & ONNX

A comprehensive deep learning pipeline for image classification, integrating PyTorch, MLflow, and ONNX for model
tracking and deployment.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. It
features:

* **PyTorch** for model development and training
* **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model management
* **ONNX** for model export and interoperability

## Features

* Custom CNN architecture tailored for FashionMNIST
* Training loop with early stopping and learning rate scheduling
* MLflow integration for logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts
* ONNX model export for deployment in diverse environments
* Signature inference for model input/output schema


## Dependencies

* Python 3.12
* PyTorch
* MLflow
* ONNX
* torchvision
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
